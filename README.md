Tired of trite abstract meanderings on the deep meaning to be found in the world? Want to read about local events,

**Install the MudedeEternalizer, and all of Mudede's ridonculous posts will magically disappear from Slog!!!**

The **MudedeEternalizer** is a Greasemonkey script which traverses Slog:http://slog.thestranger.com/, spelunking
the sloggy caves in search of Mudede posts, and rooting them out before you even see them.
